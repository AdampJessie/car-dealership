# Car Dealership

## Description of the Project
This is a virtual car dealership, fully outfitted with an inventory of vehicles to search and choose from. The program
reads from a file, populates the dealership, allows for modification, and then saves any changes to the dealership when
the user exits the program. Currently, searching allows users to input year, price, mileage, make/model, color, or vehicle 
type to search for their dream car.


## User Stories
- As an owner, I'd like to add a dealership as an object containing an inventory of vehicles so that I may contain my inventory in one organized spot and potentially add more dealerships.
- As an owner, I'd like read input from a file so that I may upload raw information to be swiftly organized and easily modifiable.
- As a customer, I'd like an intuitive menu so that I may select from a range of options and reduce the hassle of searching for and buying a car.
- As a customer, I'd like the ability to search for specific vehicles so that I may find the exact car that I'd like from a selection.
